 * 
 * BED_LEVELING_METHOD 1
 * This measures a grid. Probe point 1 is the origin and points 2 and 3 span a grid. We measure
 * BED_LEVELING_GRID_SIZE points in each direction and compute a regression plane through all
 * points. This gives a good overall plane if you have small bumps measuring inaccuracies.

 * BED_LEVELING_METHOD 2
 * Bending correcting 4 point measurement. This is for cantilevered beds that have the rotation axis
 * not at the side but inside the bed. Here we can assume no bending on the axis and a symmetric
 * bending to both sides of the axis. So probe points 2 and 3 build the symmetric axis and
 * point 1 is mirrored to 1m across the axis. Using the symmetry we then remove the bending
 * from 1 and use that as plane.
